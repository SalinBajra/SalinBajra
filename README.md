# Sales Operations Analytics Dashboard (Looker Studio)

## Overview
This project is a business analytics dashboard built using **Google (Looker) Studio** to improve visibility into sales and recruitment operations.

The goal was to replace manual reporting with a centralized, interactive view of key performance metrics.

---

## Problem Statement
Sales and recruitment teams relied heavily on:
- Manual Excel reporting  
- Fragmented data sources  
- Delayed performance insights  

This led to slower decision-making and limited operational visibility.

---

## Solution
I designed a Looker Studio dashboard that:
- Visualizes pipeline health and conversion metrics  
- Tracks vendor and candidate performance  
- Enables quick filtering by time, status, and source  

---

## Key Metrics Tracked
- Pipeline volume & movement  
- Vendor-wise performance  
- Submission-to-closure ratios  
- Weekly and monthly trends  

---

## Tools Used
- Google (Looker) Studio  
- Google Sheets (data source)  
- Business logic & KPI design  

---

## Impact
- Reduced manual reporting effort  
- Improved weekly sales review discussions  
- Enabled faster, data-backed decisions  

---

## Next Improvements
- Automate data ingestion using Python  
- Add predictive insights using AI models  
- Integrate CRM data directly via APIs
